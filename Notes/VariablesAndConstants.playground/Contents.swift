// VARIABLES & CONSTANTS (and comments)


// An immutable object CANNOT be updated or changed
// constants (starting with the word let) are immutable


// a mutable object CAN be updated or changed
// variables are mutable


/*
 Why we use constants:
 1. the compiler knows it should never be changed, and will not let you build or run your code if it is changed somwhere within your program
 2. it takes less space and makes our code more efficient
 3. it's the swift way
 */


/* TODO:
 Imagine you're calculating information about the distance traveled on a trip.
 The program can be reused, but it tracks only one trip at a time.
 Would you represent the following values with constants or variables? What might they look like?
 - starting location
 - destination
 - current location
 - distance traveled
 - remaining distance
 */

/*
You must follow:
 1. no mathematical symbols
 2. no spaces
 3. cannot begin with a number
 */

/*
You should follow:
 1. clear and descriptive
 2. camel case
